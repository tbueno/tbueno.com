    <p>Dave Grohl always seemed to be a great guy. Sometimes too great to be true: always smiling, joking like a
        teenager and always doing to right thing. It almost looked like a fake character, to be honest.</p>

    <p>Dave Grohl always seemed to be a great guy. Sometimes too great to be true: always smiling, joking like a
        teenager and always doing to right thing. It almost looked like a fake character, to be honest.</p>
    <p>It was also interesting to me to realize how much we over estimate the presence of Kurt Cobain in his life. As
        Dave himself says in the book, he will always be remembered "the guy from Nirvana", but it is crazy to think
        that his relationship with Kurt lasted just 3 years. If we consider that Foo Fighters is an almost 30-year old
        band, and that Dave has other projects and different bands through his life, we can easily say that he outgrew
        his own history in one of the most important bands in history, by delivering constantly good music and nurturing
        great partnerships in the industry.</p>

    <h3>Mister Nice Guy</h3>

    <p>Talking about being a nice guy, it is great to see how Dave humbling references his music idols. We can find any
        trace of egotism or self-indulgence from his side, which maybe helps explain why he is such a well-loved guys in
        an industry full of assholes and divas.</p>
